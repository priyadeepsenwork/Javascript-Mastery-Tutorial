Javascript is a lightweight JIT compiled programming language with first class functions.
Scripting Language for webpages.
NodeJS, ApacheCloudDB, AdobeAcrobat
Javascript is a prototype based, Multi-Paradigm, Single threaded dynamic language. Supporing object oriented programming and functional programming.

Multi-Paradigm: Ability to use different programming styles: POP, OOP, FP

Prototype based programming: Its a style of object-oriented-programming in which classes are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class, or, less frequently by adding them to an empty object.

this allows creation of object without defining its class.

Jit(Just-In-Time) compilation is a process of compilation in which the code is
translated from an intermediate representation or a higher-level language(JS) 
into machine code at 'runtime', rather than prior to execution. This is to boost the performance while loading webpages. 

Javascript engines: 
    V8              -> Chrome, NodeJS by Google
    SpiderMonkey    -> Firefox, by Mozilla
    JavascriptCore  -> Safari by Apple
    Hermes          -> React Native by Meta

========================================================================

Execution context: When JS scans a script file, it makes an environment called the
Execution context that handles the entire transformation and execution of code.

Call Stack: It is used to keep track of all the contexts, including global and functional. Its also calld the Execution context stack, Runtime Stack or Machine Stack. It uses LIFO principle.

The Call stack has its own fixed size depending on browseror system.
If the number of contexts exceeds the limit, then a stack overflow error will occur.
Eg: Recursive function with no base condition.
